         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I am I confe≈ø≈øe naturally apt to an≈øwer thee with ≈øcoffs for thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches wherewith thou ha≈øt reproached God which are fallen upon me.

            <p>And further, I ≈øay if by Anabapti≈øts thou meane≈øt Antebapti≈øts, that is, oppo≈øers of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme of the Go≈øpell, let all judge whether thou be not the man for thou maintaining the ≈øprinkeling of infants, without any warrant from the Law or Go≈øpell to be the Ordinance of Chri≈øt, and neglect the dipping beleevers, held out in the whole Tenour of the Go≈øpell, peculiarly to be the alone Ordinance of Chri≈øt, and to keepe the poore people in ignorance, the Prie≈øts being the tran≈ølators of the Bible, where they ≈øhould have ≈øet the Engli≈øh word Dip, that all might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, they have ≈øet the Greeke word Baptize, that ≈øo they keeping the people ignorant might ≈øprincle infants, pretending it the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chri≈øt without any Scripture to prove the ≈øame, and being a≈øhamed of the name due to your practi≈øe, namely antebapti≈øts, you ca≈øt the a≈øpertion of that name upon them that practi≈øe the dipping beleevers according to the Ordinance of Chri≈øt in the teanour of the Go≈øpell, as a cunning thiefe being pur≈øued, cryeth among others; ≈øtop thiefe, ≈øtop thiefe, to cau≈øe the people not to ≈øu≈øpect him.</p>
            <p>And further; for as much as thou ha≈øt not one word of God to beare thee out, judge thy ≈øelf, if thou be not exceeding audacious to ≈øay that thou ha≈øt fully an≈øwered in this they libellous booke what≈øoever is or can bee ≈øaid again≈øt it.</p>

            <p>Again, thou ≈øai≈øt, that having but little trading for my Axe; I u≈øe it to cut off men in bodies politicke: What more lies yet? I confe≈ø≈øe, thou mighte≈øt not lie ≈øo willingly as before, for I in≈øtanced indeed in bodies politick for illu≈øtration? but thou may≈øt ≈øee that I conclude, that our Saviour ≈øpeaks there of a ≈øpirituall bodie, or Church, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible Saints, or ≈øuch as vi≈øibly appeard ≈øo to be, which he owns for his vi≈øible Church, and ≈øearcheth the heart him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Again, thou ≈øai≈øt, I dare not tell what the offence is, le≈øt I ≈øhould be hanged, ≈øee thou wilt imagine lies rather then thou wilt be out of the exerci≈øe of them: whereas the Reader may ≈øee I did but ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øuch a thing for illu≈øtration, as in the <hi>Offending Eye,</hi> pag. 25.</p>
            <p>Again, as never wearie of lying, thou ≈øai≈øt, that for his being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate, that offending the Anabapti≈øts, is that for which I would have him cut off: although he were faithfull to King and State, the which I and tho≈øe whom thou Antebapti≈øt reproachfully calle≈øt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øts, do utterly denie and abhorre; and do heartily de≈øire the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all civill Laws e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Word of God, and grieve that the good Laws of <hi>England</hi> are no better executed. And thou further ≈øai≈øt, that I think Magi≈øtrates ought to be cut off for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wars, wherein both Parliament and Magi≈øtrates will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee for a liar, who know that I have u≈øed my utmo≈øt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to further their de≈øignes, but indeed, with de≈øire of as much ≈øpare of bloud as might lawfully be.</p>
            <p>Then thou charge≈øt me that I ≈øay that the members of the my≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie whereof I u≈øed not the phra≈øe mu≈øt be cut off, but I ≈øhew not the offence, wherefore I an≈øwer thee, poore ignorant ≈øoule, that if thou knewe≈øt what it were to be a member of a Church of Chri≈øt, thou woulde≈øt know that owning and maintaining any ≈øin again≈øt God is offence to his true Church, and to every true living member in it. And whereas thou ≈øai≈øt that I would have them cut off for every ≈øin. I an≈øwer, the Churches of Chri≈øts dare not cut off any member till they appeare to be ≈øuch as Chri≈øt would have to be cut off name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rotten or un≈øound ones: which the wilfull owning any knowne fin again≈øt admonition, denominates any to be. And whereas thou ≈øai≈øt thou wilt rake the hammer of Gods Word, anti-≈øpirit my ≈øhell, and give a farther ta≈øte of the devilli≈øh kernell that is in me, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>re ≈øoule, if the Lord would plea≈øe to make thee an in≈øtrument in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s
<pb facs="tcp:159165:4"/>hand, to di≈øcover to me that devilli≈øhne≈ø≈øe that is in mee, which yet I ≈øee not, I hope I ≈øhould thankfully take notice of my ≈øin, and prai≈øe him for thee as his in≈øtrument, but poore heart thou knowe≈øt not yet how to handle that hammer to break thine own heart, if thou can≈øt ca≈øt the beame, or if but a moat out of thine eye, thou ≈øhalt ≈øee the cleerer to help thy brother, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. And whereas thou demande≈øt of me, if the not cutting off a member from the vi≈øible bodie or Church, cau≈øe the body to bee ca≈øt into hell. Judge you whether if a foot that carrieth the bodie, or a hand that draws or drives, or an eye that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the bodie thitherward if it be not cut off, will not bring it thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Again, thou ≈øai≈øt, that if Chri≈øt were on earth again, I would be offended at him, for many were offended at him, it is true; and thou poore ≈øoul art offended at him, and oppo≈øe≈øt his way as truly as <hi>Paul</hi> did when he was going to <hi>Dama≈øcus,</hi> although thou thinke≈øt not ≈øo, The Lord, if it be his will, ≈øhew thee him≈øelfe as he did to him. Then thou affirme≈øt, that the meaning of cutting off a member, is the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the corruption of the members: then I conceive, it would be ≈øaid, Wa≈øh or clen≈øe thy members, as el≈øe where, clen≈øe your ≈øelves from all filthine≈ø≈øe of fle≈øh and ≈øpirit. 2 Cor. 7.1.</p>
            <p>But thou affirme≈øt, that if wee cannot cut off lu≈øts without the members, we mu≈øt cut off the member, and ≈øai≈øt we ≈øhall have it at the Re≈øurrection. I pray thee doth not the Apo≈øtles ≈øay, No man ever hated his own fle≈øh but nouri≈øhed it, and whereas thou ≈øai≈øt we ≈øhould be as much offended with the evill of ≈øin, that is in the eye, as the evill of pain in the tooth: I pray thee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øider, doth not Chri≈øt ≈øay that from within, namely, from the heart, comes evill thoughts and lu≈øts, and ≈øo do not the heart employ the eie, the tongue, the care, the hand, and all to ≈øerve its turn. And ≈øo as our Saviour ≈øaith, An evill man out of the evill trea≈øury of his heart, bringeth forth: evill things: he doth not ≈øay, Out of the evill trea≈øure of his eie, or hand, or foot, but of his heart, and marke thy ab≈øurdity, which poor ≈øoule thou can≈øt not ≈øee: Thou ≈øai≈øt when all means is u≈øed, &amp; our eie, hand or foot will not be reclamed: we mu≈øt cut them off, or pluck them out rather then employ them to our eternall ruine of bodie and ≈øoul. Marke, you ≈øaid even now, if wee could not reclaime them, and now yee ≈øay wee employ them; then if the fountain fill the channels will it find fault, and cut them off for running, when being filled from it, they cannot cea≈ø≈øe running: ≈øo if the heart employ the eie, hand, and foot, and enforce their acting, and without it they act not good or evill, will or can the
<pb facs="tcp:159165:4"/>heart cut them off for obeying its command. Again, thou, as never weary of thy lying, charge≈øt me that I ≈øay to Chri≈øt, if thy hand, foot, or eye offend thee, do ≈øo and ≈øo; whereas there is not ≈øuch a word in my book. Again, where as thou blinde ≈øoul ≈øai≈øt, I ≈øpeak of two eyes, two hands, &amp; two feet in his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall bodie, and carnally aske which is the right eye, or the right hand, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer thee, pittying thy ignorance, though a body politicke loo≈øe half the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it is a whole body ≈øtill: As the Corporation of <hi>London,</hi> if there were a 1000 members more it were but a body: ≈øo if it loo≈øe 2000, it is a compleat body ≈øtill: although if many of them taken away were eminent, it would ≈øeem as a maimed body in compari≈øon of what it was before. And whereas thou ≈øai≈øt, that all the brains in the <hi>Nutt,</hi> knows not how to an≈øwer thee; I an≈øwer, if he do know, no thank to him: but whereas thou ≈øpeake≈øt of two eyes in a Church, and ≈øai≈øt if one offend and be excommunicate, and the other die in the mean time, that ≈øo it leave all blinde. I an≈øwer thy carnall objection thus: that in a body politick, every member in a greater or le≈ø≈øer mea≈øure ≈øhould execute the office of the eye, hand and foot, and of every other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the good of the body ye may all prophe≈øie one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted, 1 Cor. 14. and ≈øo ought all to bee helpfull to the body, although the bodie may e≈øpecially chu≈øe tho≈øe be≈øt gifted. Then thou ≈øai≈øt, Well thus you ≈øee that Chri≈øt here ≈øpeaketh of our naturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers but doe≈øt thou judge ≈øo, or thinke that any that have any ≈øpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God do judge it ≈øo: ≈øurely if thou do≈øt it, is becau≈øe thou feare≈øt not God, for he revealeth his ≈øecrets to them that fear him, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 25.14. Again, thou ≈øai≈øt, that a man in grace mu≈øt needs grieve to ≈øee his members act ≈øin, I aske thee, whether the heart or ≈øome other part of the body it be that grieves for tho≈øe actions of the eye, hand, or foot, if it be the heart: con≈øider I pray thee, do that grieve that its ≈øervants do its will, for from it they ≈øpeak, look, &amp; act: And whereas thou ≈øai≈øt that the Word if, is not a word of diffedence, where it is ≈øaid? If God be God follow him, I ≈øay ≈øo al≈øo, and never ≈øaid again≈øt it, yet I do ≈øay, it implies if he be not God, do not follow him, and ≈øo of the re≈øt, thou bringe≈øt for that purpo≈øe. And whereas thou ≈øai≈øt, we ≈øhould binde our eyes, hands &amp; feet with the cords of a Covenant, and then in≈øtance≈øt, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.1. and ≈øai≈øt, <hi>Iob made a covenant with his eyes not to look on a maid:</hi> whereas hee ≈øaith no ≈øuch thing, but ≈øaith; <hi>I made covenant with mine eyes, why then ≈øhould I think upon a maid.</hi> Whence I infer, that through grace, he having re≈øolved again≈øt acting ≈øin, through the ≈øtrength given him of God he is now grieved with him≈øelf: and implore ≈øtrength from God again≈øt the fir≈øt thoughts and motions thereunto. And thus I conceive, he intends, I am by grace re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to commit a lu≈øtfull action with; nor ca≈øt a lu≈øtfull look on a woman: but then why am I yet troubled with the fir≈øt motions and thoughts of it; Lord help me agin≈øt them al≈øo, and ≈øpeaks not of, nor intends any other cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as if the heart and the members were at one time different one from the other: for then that body were divided again≈øt it ≈øelf; and ≈øo as a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome divided could not ≈øtand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.25. &amp; ≈øo there needs no tying together with the cords of a Covenant, as you affirme. Then, as never weary of lying: thou ≈øai≈øt that my expo≈øitiou is that the eye there intended, is the Mini≈øter, I an≈øwer, ≈øo it is? But thou ≈øai≈øt, I ≈øay, if he be blinde, all the Annabapti≈øts are blinde al≈øo, whereas I ≈øay no ≈øuch thing: but if he be an hereticall wicked
<pb facs="tcp:159165:5"/>man, and they walk by his light, they namely, every man and woman of that body walking by the light of their wicked eye or Mini≈øter, which is darknes, they namely, all the body or Church will be full of darknes, Mat. 6.23. and except they obey God in plucking out this wicked eye, they are not his true Di≈øciples, but ≈øeeming ≈øo, and ≈øo they being blinde, are led by their blinde eye, or Mini≈øter, till <hi>both fall into the ditch,</hi> namely Hell: Again, to leave many of thy ignorant fooli≈øh erationall rea≈øonings, becau≈øe an≈øwering a fool accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all his fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe were to be like him; which were to make my book tedious, as thine is, but now another palpable lye, as the thief crying ≈øtop thief, thou fathere≈øt upon me, as any that will be plea≈øed to read my book, called the offending eye, hand and foot, which they may have for a penny, being that which thou oppo≈øe≈øt, may ≈øee. But to returne to another lye of thine, that it ≈øeemes cannot refrain lying thou ≈øai≈øt, I flatly contradict Chri≈øt, ≈øaying, that I ≈øay, that the taking away of corruptions; wounds the man, which is the expo≈øition of thy blinde guides whom thou ≈øo adore≈øt, and that the reader may know thy lying and fal≈øehood; I will quote the pages in my book which thou oppo≈øe≈øt: this thy la≈øt lie may be found in pag. 21. of my book called <hi>The offending eye, hand and foot:</hi> Again, thou aske≈øt how I will con≈øter the two hands, two feet, or two eyes of the vi≈øible bedy of Chri≈øt, for that is my term, not my≈øticall as thou fal≈øely affirme≈øt, thus I an≈øwer that it is Chri≈øts compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon taken from a naturall body that hath but two of each of tho≈øe members, and thefore he ≈øpeakes ≈øo of them in the name of 2 of each of tho≈øe members, but you ≈øee in civill bodies politique, as in this City there is every yeere a new hand of power, nomely, a L. Major, ≈øo alwaies in bodies politicke, either ≈øpirituall or temporall, though many be cut off by death or otherwi≈øe, yet there are more to come in their places by order of the ≈øurviving or living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but poore ≈øoule thou having not received the love of the tryth; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, Chri≈øts words are given to thee yet in parables, that hearing thou under≈øtande≈øt not, and ≈øeeing thou perceive≈øt not; the Lord open thy ≈øpirituall eyes and eares, and give thee unner≈øtanding what his Spirituall body is; and make thee a true ≈øpirituall member thereof, for his glory and thy comfort.</p>
            <p>After this thou fal≈øely taxe≈øt me to ≈øay that your Mini≈øters have no faith, which I deny, but do ≈øay they are not faithfull Mini≈øters, by vertue of any thing they had from the unpurged fountaines of the Univer≈øities. Then you come to prove yours the Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and you begin to ≈øhew that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his mini≈øtery of his Father. And the Ape≈øtles delivered what they received of Chri≈øt in his power and way, which we grant, and them we own for his Mini≈øtrs, but as the Devill ≈øaid, <hi>Ie≈øus we know,</hi> and <hi>Paul we know, but who are ye,</hi> ≈øo Chri≈øt we acknowledge, and the Apo≈øtles we ackno≈øhledge; but who are your Mini≈øters, if you or they can prove them≈øelves the Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, we will thankfully hear and joyfully ebrace them. Again, you ≈øay, if your Mini≈øters build their doctrines upon the Apo≈øtles and Prophets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition or detraction: the Go≈øpell will remain in its integrity. Ala≈ø≈øe ≈øilly creature can any thing de≈øtroy the integritie of the Ga≈øpel. Wherefore break off thy bla≈øphemies, and intreat God with <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> if it be po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee, which my ≈øoul humbly entreats the Lord to do for thee, for his glory and thy comfort. Farewell.</p>
